Feb 9th,10th:
-Setup and check

Feb 10th:
- Setup github in home directory and as public repository to check working
- Tried to update paths and find path to xrootd, 
issues found where there are interlinking path to /afs and/nfs directories.

Feb 11th
- Create new and clean conda environment to test code
Used: 
    conda create -n acd_test -c conda-forge python=3.10 fermitools xrootd gcc_linux-64 gxx_linux-64 root
Note, this might work without fermitools, but adding it here just in case. To troubleshoot make a new version without fermitools to see if it works
Remember for conda, start with:
    export CONDA_PREFIX=/sdf/home/a/abhishek/miniconda
    export PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX}/bin/:$PATH
    source ${CONDA_PREFIX}/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
- Made directory releases,wrkdir and python to start working
- Added config file which is also uploaded to github
- Made folders as stated in DGreen doc.

Feb 13th
- Added setup for terminal to fermi environment (can only be run from fermi-devl)
   For future reference:
   ssh -Y abhishek@s3dflogin-mfa.slac.stanford.edu
   ssh fermi-devl
- Following steps from DGreen doc.
  Made scons_make like stated and ran cv checkout.
  Updated mootcore file ... 
- Issues with python2!!!! and python 3!!!!, cant change every python call...yet.... so changing conda environment
 new environment (note anydependancies added later are also added in this one path)
 conda create -n acd_test2 -c conda-forge python=2.7 xrootd root=6.16 scons f2c gfortran gcc_linux-64=7 gxx_linux-64=7 libstdcxx-ng=7
